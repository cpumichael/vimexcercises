There are MANY vim settings.

This is mine.

let loaded_matchparen = 1
set nocompatible
set modeline
" Optional, but I like it
set ts=4
" Optional, but I like it
set sw=4
set et
set showmatch
set ai
set nrformats-=octal
set hlsearch

I see modeline as a must have as options for formating can be
added to the file and then everyone can have the same options.
The biggest things to have there are ts sw et ai as different
languages have different formatting options.

For example, go uses tabs and not spaces for indentation.
Python is the opposite.

go has go fmt and that "just works" and is not worth debate.
python is not that advanced yet, so we have to rely on
adherance to pep8 or modifications of it.

C and C++ are free for alls.  Everyone has thier own opinion
on style and formatting.
