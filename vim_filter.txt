In vim you must be able to quickly clean a file.

Example excercise:
    open vim with a new document
    then do: :r!ps auxww
    now the document is full of processes on the computer and the cursor is at the end of the document
    go to the top of the document (gg is easiest, :0 works as well)
    go down a couple of lines until your cursor is on the USER PID ... header line
    now remove all of the unneded header information at the top of the document: dgg (delete to beginning of document)
    now lets filter the document for all non-root user processes
    go to the top of docuemnt: gg
    use visual mode: v
    go to end of document: G
    now all of document is "highlighted"
    now simply do: :!grep -v \^root
    now the document has all non-root processes
    now lets sort all of the processes by PID in reverse order
    highlight the document again in visual mode: ggvG
    then filter: :!sort -nk 2 -r
    now the document is sorted by the second "key" which is PID column, numerically, in reverse order
    now lets sort/group by username
    highlight all of the document: ggvG
    then filter: :!sort -k 1

Example excercise visual block:
    open up vim in new window in this directory
    do this: :r!grep . *
    now you can clean up the filenames on the left by doing
    use block visual mode: ^v
    move around and delete the filenames by highighting up to the colon
    and the hit d
